                    Soul is one of the best animated feature movies I have ever seen(Opinion may differ in future).
                    The best thing about this movie is that it never keeps you bored. It will make you laugh, feel
                    and mesmerized at the same time. The credit goes to the direction and the writing for never
                    leaving us bored. The story is about Joe Gardner who loves Jazz music and he teaches the same
                    in a school. No one respects his art as many times he had failed in this. One day he got the gig
                    he has been waiting for years. He is on the way to his house and accidentally he falls in a pothole
                    and now he is in the hospital in a unconscious condition. Actually, His soul is on the way to the 
                    great beyond. He dont want to die because this is the day he has been waiting for years. Somehow 
                    he ran back and go to the great before where all the souls went to aerth to start a life. There 
                    he met 22(a soul) who is waiting for the purpose to live on purpose from years. 22 dont want to
                    go on earth. Somehow they both went to earth and now 22 is in Joe's body and Joe is in a Cat's body.
                    they both are on the way to make the things right. But in the way Joe recognises 22 is enjoying more 
                    on earth. 22 is actually enjoying the life. After some hustle between both of them, 22 is now a 
                    depressed soul and Joe completes his much needed gig. But suddenly after it He recognises that 22 
                    deserves a life on earth and he does not. He went to the great beyond and gave 22 the earth card
                    and he is gifted to continue his life. Being asked how he will spend his life, he answers, "I will
                    live every moment of it". This movie is a perfect comedy and feel you need during this pandemic.
